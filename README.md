# Create TF statistic features

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to create a new Text-Fabric feature:

  - [num_words](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/features/num_words.html): Number of word nodes below this node.

More statistic features may be added in the future.
   
The final feature files will be added to the package available at the [tonyjurg/N1904addons](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/) repository.

## About Text-Fabric

The Text-Fabric framework is designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large-scale textual data, particularly in the context of ancient languages and biblical texts. The engine of Text-Fabric is its powerful Python library, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and querying structured text data efficiently. The software package is accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric).
